Firstly, in order to run the game at its current state, you must have pygame, pyganim, numpy and easygui python libraries
installed because this game was never built into an executable. For a general idea of how the game looks and performs,
screenshots are available in the screenshots folder. Most game code is found in the game.py file.

The game can be run by opening game.py in the Arrowhero. The arrow information and high scores are stored in seperate files in this folder. 
The game may be a little laggy at the start of each song and in song selection depending on the speed of the computer. 

In order to add arrows to a difficulty of a song that doesn't have arrows, simply open songcreator.py, type the name of the song file when the
program asks you and the music will start playing. Clicking the arrow keys will save the timing for the specific arrow key and the arrow key 
is created. To get the arrow information, press tab and then copy the entire list printed and paste it in arrowplacements.txt replacing the
word "none". This was the process used to add all the difficulties already available.
